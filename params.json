However, this project is under active development and not yet official released.\r\n\r\n\r\n##Screenshots\r\n\r\n[See here] (misc/screenshots/SCREENSHOTS.md)\r\n\r\n##Demos\r\n\r\n[See here a dedicated demo page] (http://pearls-media.com:89/demo)\r\n\r\n\r\n##Important\r\n\r\nThis a development version. It has many sub modules and needs around 1GB on the disc. You may download a pre-built version from here(@TODO add link) \r\n\r\n## Requirements \r\n\r\n- PHP 5.3+ (better 5.4!)\r\n\r\n## Installation \r\n\r\n### Quick installation without any Git\r\n \r\n[See here] (docs/installation.md)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Soft Checkout (Uses pre-compiled Javascript version)\r\n\r\n``` bash \r\n    git clone https://github.com/mc007/xbox-app\r\n    cd xbox-app\r\n    git submodules init\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Full Checkout (Checks out full tree: 1GB+)\r\n\r\n``` bash \r\n    git clone --recursive https://github.com/mc007/xbox-app    \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\nNavigate on your web server to : **http://localhost/xbox-app/index.php**\r\n\r\nOpen in different layout modes, append the entry URL by: \r\n\r\nindex.php?**layout=single**: Single panel\r\n\r\nindex.php?**layout=dual**: Dual panel\r\n\r\nindex.php?**layout=preview**:  Preview layout (split view with media preview)\r\n\r\nindex.php?**layout=preview&theme=dot-luv**: Preview layout in dark theme (split view with media preview)\r\n\r\nindex.php?**layout=preview&open=Pictures**: Auto open picture folder in preview mode (split view with media preview)\r\n\r\nindex.php?**layout=gallery&open=BurningMan&minimal=true&theme=dot-luv**: Auto open picture folder in gallery mode (split view with cover flow view)\r\n\r\nindex.php?**layout=browser&open=Pictures**: Auto open picture folder in browser mode (Dual view with tree for navigation, classics!)\r\n\r\n  \r\n### Open debug version \r\n\r\nhttp://localhost/xbox-app/index.php?debug=true\r\n\r\n### Build Javascript main file\r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n    cd client/src\r\n    sh buildstandalone.sh    \r\n```\r\nThis will create single layer file which contains all Dojo based in src/xfile/dojo/xbox.js!\r\n\r\n### Resources (Javascript/CSS/Fonts,...)\r\n- Client-Debug version : see in client/src/lib/xbox/resources-debug.json\r\n- Client-Release version : see in client/src/xfile/xbox/resources-release.json\r\n\r\n#### Footprint\r\n- Javascript total: 3MB (2MB Core + 1MB plugins) unzipped or 1.2 MB when gzipped\r\n- CSS total: 50KB\r\n- Images: 20KB - 50KB. We do optimize it further\r\n- XHR: 50KB for the initial load(gzipped)\r\n- Total: 1.4MB gzipped\r\n\r\nThere are further optimizations in progress but we don't think we can get the minimal version below 700KB!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### The Index.html\r\nThere is no such thing! HTML related parts are pulled through the resource configuration mentioned in \"Resources\" above.\r\nThis technique has been proven for us since many years in many projects as we develop authoring software and those resources\r\nneeded to be managed in a more fashioned manner. However,\r\n\r\nthe **HEAD** comes from:\r\n- Client-Debug version : client/src/lib/xbox/Header.js\r\n- Client-Release version : client/src/xfile/xbox/Header.js\r\n\r\nthe **BODY** part comes from:\r\n\r\n- Client-Debug version : client/src/lib/xbox/index.html\r\n- Client-Release version : client/src/xfile/xbox/index.html\r\n\r\n### The index.php\r\n\r\n 1. Is more of interest to you, it basically does setup a 'xfile' configuration and fires the PHP framework\r\n 2. Handles RPC and client rendering\r\n\r\n\r\n### Update all\r\n``` bash\r\ncd xbox-app\r\ngit submodule foreach git pull origin master\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Contribute\r\nopen a Github issue and let me know :-)\r\n\r\n###Roadmap\r\n1. Update to ibm-js framework\r\n2. remove all Dijit stuff\r\n3. Code cleanup\r\n4. Create a Node.js server version\r\n5. Add proper test units \r\n6. ...\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
